And what is left of the battery after these processes are the chemical and mineral components, the ‘black mass’. The black mass typically consists of a mixture of lithium, manganese, cobalt and nickel in different ratios. Of these, nickel – and especially cobalt – are the most valuable and most difficult to recover.</p>

      <p>The hydrometallurgical recycling process involves a chemical precipitation methodology that allows scarce minerals to be recovered and delivered to battery manufacturers for reuse in the production of new batteries. </p>",90% less CO2 emissions than traditional method_80% metal extraction efficiency_Developed by the Finnish growth company Crisolteq,Li-ion batteries_Black mass_Metal alloy,"<h3>Harjavalta Industrial Park</h1>

<p>This combustible anaerobic end product possesses a wide range of uses, including creating energy. Biogas generates heat and/or electricity when ignited, and can further be transformed into vehicular fuels and renewable natural gas. Other material left over following anaerobic digestion is known as “digestate”—typically a wet combination that can be separated into liquids and nutrient-rich solids.<p/>",Cuts harmful methane emissions that fuel climate change_Prevent and reduce wasted animal manure and other organic materials from ending up in landfills,Animal manure_Food waste_Human waste,"<h3>Yaphank Facility</h1>
